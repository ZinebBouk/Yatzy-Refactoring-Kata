# Yatzy Game Refacto

This Java program is the result of my refactoring exercise on the main implementation of the Yatzy game, aimed at improving the code. It was forked from the repository.

The Yatzy game is a simple dice game where each player rolls five six-sided dice. They have the option to re-roll some or all of the dice up to three times, including the original roll.
